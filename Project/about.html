      <h2>About Intell√≠ Learning</h2>
      <p>
        Wre're a nonprofit community that envision a world where anyone,
        anywhere has the power to transform their life through learning. Every
        individual has the potential to create change, whether in their life,
        their community, or the world. The transformative power of education is
        what unlocks that potential. Yet, access to high-quality education has
        been a privilege of the few.
      </p>
      <br /><br /><br />
      <h2>Our mission</h2>
      <p>
        There are three commitments we've made to the world. We've been grounded
        by these since day one:
      </p>
      <br />
      <ul>
        <li>Easy access to high quality content for everyone</li>
        <li>
          Ease the pain of learners trying to scrape the web for hours to learn
          from the best
        </li>
        <li>Providing quality content at the tip of our learners hands</li>
      </ul>
      <br /><br /><br />
      <h2>Our beliefs</h2>
      <p>
        Learning is the source of human progress. It has the power to transform
        our world from illness to health, from poverty to prosperity, from
        conflict to peace. It has the power to transform our lives for
        ourselves, for our families, for our communities. No matter who we are
        or where we are, learning empowers us to change and grow and redefine
        what‚Äôs possible. That‚Äôs why access to the best learning is a right, not
        a privilege. And that‚Äôs why Intell√≠ learning is here. We scrape the
        internet for you to present you with best and free online courses and
        tutorials availabe for you to learn with. So that anyone, anywhere has
        the power to transform their life through learning.
      </p>
      <br /><br /><br />
      <h2>Can you invest in Intell√≠ Learning</h2>
      <p>
        We are a public charity, so technically you already own Intell√≠
        Learning. Nobody can own shares of a public charity, and it cannot be
        bought or sold. So you'll continue to own a part of Intell√≠ Learning
        whether you like it or not. üòâ This said, we would welcome your
        donations. The only way you can directly influence Intell√≠ Learning,
        though, is to roll up your sleeves and contribute to our project.
